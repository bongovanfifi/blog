It allows you to iteratively build multi-word anagrams. It also allows you to add and use any arbitrary nonsense word you want. If there’s some slang you find funny or meaningful, or a missing word, go ahead, throw it in."

    "text": "Implementation Details (Boring)\n\nAlgorithms and LLMs\nThe classic way to solve these anagram problems is using some kind of Counter-like structure. However, I wanted to get all substring anagrams. This is basically a permutation problem, and calculating permutations is really slow, O(n!) time. We could use caching, but why do that when we can just write a good algorithm instead? I take the word lists and create word maps where the key is the sorted characters, and the value is an array of all the words that correspond to the word sorted. Then, I just sort the input and write a combination algorithm O(2^n) and return those.\n\n\nFrameworks, Languages\nI used React for a couple reasons. First, I had to use it professionally, so I already know it. Second, I wanted it to be able to work entirely client-side and offline (though I know there are other ways to do this). Also, it seemed like a natural fit for a small stateful app. I thought it would be pretty pleasant without all the Redux store nonsense, this would be an opportunity for React to really shine. It was… only okay! Kind of annoying. I experienced the standard annoyances with managing state and triggering/avoiding rerenders, race conditions. Honestly, a lot of these annoyances are just inherent to this sort of reactive application."

    "text": "I was recently furloughed, the startup I was at ran out of money. They may very well turn it all around, but I’m still looking for a job. To keep myself productive I’ve been using a big Google Tasks list, where the tasks are attached to some date. I am consistently too aggressive with what I assign every day. I put on around 10 tasks fully expecting to have to push off many of them. I’m getting up earlier and earlier to try and get more done. This has been generally pretty good, but I was finding that the pressure of so many tasks makes focus work hard. I also felt it unfairly penalizes repeated study work in favor of little one-off tasks.\nI was interviewing with a defense company a bit ago, they gave me a 48-hour data engineering takehome project. Naturally, I planned not to do anything else in that period. I got almost all of it done on the first day, and just futzed with it on the second. Turned it in and got a request for a follow up interview a couple of hours later, so that was neat. I got seven interviews deep, but it didn’t work out. My lack of top-secret clearance and lack of experience in that particular position probably didn’t help! By the by, their submission link wasn’t working. I sent them a git bundle of the repo, didn’t hear back, so I just made the repo public and sent them a link. They didn’t seem to mind so it’s still public.\nBut I really enjoyed dedicating an entire day to a project, so I’ve been keeping the habit. a rag man and this Streamlit cost input tool were both one-day MVPs. This is a much better system than trying to chip away at three projects at a time.\nOn days where I plan to do more than one thing I’ve taken to aggressively timeboxing everything using a funny little study timer I bought on a trip to Japan. I’ll set an hour for leetcode, or an hour for misc. tasks (making calls, cleaning, etc.) and won’t task switch until the timer is over. Previous productivity systems I’ve tried have been too rigid or too ambiguous. I think this strikes a really good balance. I can easily introduce tasks like “# hours of {task}” and break it up over the course of the day or just do it all in one go. It’s basically just a modified Pomodoro system.\nI recommend trying it if you find yourself feeling like you lack a stopping point for tasks where you could do a little more, or you’re finding yourself pulled in too many directions. It feels good to know that for some period of time, you only have one thing to worry about."

Google Tasks integrates natively with Google Calendar, which as far as I can tell has become the default calendar option, and it has a nice little widget I can put on my phone to jot down tasks. The cost is basically nothing and “it just works”.\nI know about Syncthing and Obsidian, I agree using them would be better in the abstract.

    "text": "“Tilt controls” or “gyro controls” are a motion input method that promises mouse-like precision without aim assist while using a controller. It does this by using very small movements of the controller as input, almost always as an alternative to aiming with the right analog stick. While these are motion controls, the motion being detected is extremely small, rather than Wii sports style full body motion. Having a controller-based alternative that can work for any game is great for me, because I’ve found that I never want to play games at my desk using the mouse and keyboard when I’ve already been sitting at my desk using mouse and keyboard all day.\nAlso, it’s fun and intuitive. People already jerk their controller around while playing games, why not make that an input? The best part is, if you own a modern controller, you can (probably) try it without buying anything."

    "text": "An Example\nIn Helldivers 2, gyro did not work when Steam Input was off. With Steam Input on, the native support fought Steam Input’s configs and weird buggy behavior was constant. Mostly this meant my character staring into the sun while being eaten by bugs / turned into a picnic table by chainsaw-wielding robots while I fumbled with configs. So I instead mapped everything on the controller to mouse and keyboard inputs and it worked perfectly. By convincing the game you’re just using the default mouse and keyboard, you get the best supported control scheme and you can reuse your tuned personal gyro settings across games without having to petition the devs for better support and / or feature parity with whatever your favorite implementation of gyro is. Mouse and keyboard provides us with a perfect interface already, why bother with native support?\nI hear some people are good at making hybrid setups work, so I think it might be worth trying the couple most popular Steam Community layouts. I may update this later, but I haven’t tried a hybrid layout yet that “just worked”."

You probably also want to use “Roll”, which reads how the controller is “twisted” as well. If it makes sense to you that you should be able to turn the controller so the top faces left when you want to turn left, use “Roll” as well. Try out the settings, reading about them is very abstract, when you actually try the different options you will immediately understand how they work, and if you’re anything like me, one setting will seem obviously right and the rest obviously wrong. If you want to read about it anyway, here you go."
