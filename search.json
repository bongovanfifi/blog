    "text": "I made “a rag man” because the other anagram websites I found are focused on finding complete single-word anagrams, typically using the scrabble worldlist, often explicitly to win at word games.\nThis led me to build the site / word-toy “a rag man”. It allows you to iteratively build multi-word anagrams. It also allows you to add and use any arbitrary nonsense word you want. If there’s some slang you find funny or meaningful, or a missing word, go ahead, throw it in."

    "text": "Implementation Details (Boring)\n\nAlgorithms and LLMs\nThe classic way to solve these anagram problems is using some kind of Counter-like structure. However, I wanted to get all substring anagrams. This is basically a permutation problem, and calculating permutations is really slow, O(n!) time. We could use caching, but why do that when we can just write a good algorithm instead? I take the word lists and create word maps where the key is the sorted characters, and the value is an array of all the words that correspond to the word sorted. Then, I just sort the input and write a combination algorithm O(2^n) and return those.\n\n\nFrameworks, Languages\nI used React for a couple reasons. First, I had to use it professionally, so I already know it. Second, I wanted it to be able to work entirely client-side and offline (though I know there are other ways to do this). Also, it seemed like a natural fit for a small stateful app. I thought it would be pretty pleasant without all the Redux store nonsense, this would be an opportunity for React to really shine. It was… only okay! Kind of annoying. I experienced the standard annoyances with managing state and triggering/avoiding rerenders, race conditions. Honestly, a lot of these annoyances are just inherent to this sort of reactive application."

    "text": "“Tilt controls” or “gyro controls” are a motion input method that promises mouse-like precision without aim assist while using a controller. It does this by using very small movements of the controller as input, almost always as an alternative to aiming with the right analog stick. While these are motion controls, the motion being detected is extremely small, rather than Wii sports style full body motion. Having a controller-based alternative that can work for any game is great for me, because I’ve found that I never want to play games at my desk using the mouse and keyboard when I’ve already been sitting at my desk using mouse and keyboard all day.\nAlso, it’s fun and intuitive. People already jerk their controller around while playing games, why not make that an input? The best part is, if you own a modern controller, you can (probably) try it without buying anything."

    "text": "An Example\nIn Helldivers 2, gyro did not work when Steam Input was off. With Steam Input on, the native support fought Steam Input’s configs and weird buggy behavior was constant. Mostly this meant my character staring into the sun while being eaten by bugs / turned into a picnic table by chainsaw-wielding robots while I fumbled with configs. So I instead mapped everything on the controller to mouse and keyboard inputs and it worked perfectly. By convincing the game you’re just using the default mouse and keyboard, you get the best supported control scheme and you can reuse your tuned personal gyro settings across games without having to petition the devs for better support and / or feature parity with whatever your favorite implementation of gyro is. Mouse and keyboard provides us with a perfect interface already, why bother with native support?\nI hear some people are good at making hybrid setups work, so I think it might be worth trying the couple most popular Steam Community layouts. I may update this later, but I haven’t tried a hybrid layout yet that “just worked”."

I often map this to my mode switch button.\nFor some reason, in Steam Input you don’t set a gyro disable button,you set a gyro enable button (even if gyro is always on) and set the behavior of the enable button to be disabling the gyro.

You probably also want to use “Roll”, which reads how the controller is “twisted” as well. If it makes sense to you that you should be able to turn the controller so the top faces left when you want to turn left, use “Roll” as well. Try out the settings, reading about them is very abstract, when you actually try the different options you will immediately understand how they work, and if you’re anything like me, one setting will seem obviously right and the rest obviously wrong. If you want to read about it anyway, here you go."
